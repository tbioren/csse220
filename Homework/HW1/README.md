# HW1

### Overview:
- The primary objective of this assignment is to get working smoothly the process of checking out homework projects Eclipse and submitting your .java files correctly to this assignment's Moodle Dropbox
- This is an individual exercise/assignment

### Rubric:
- This homework is autograded. This means that your score is almost entirely determined by your unit test scores. If you pass 80% of the unit tests, you will get 80% on the assignment. **There is a 1 point deduction for a missing help citation.**

### To do:
1. In Eclipse, import this project (HW1) from your *local copy* of the CSSE220 repo
   - Read and follow the instructions in [importing_eclipse_project.md](https://github.com/RHIT-CSSE/csse220/tree/master/Docs/importing_eclipse_project.md)
2. Implement the two operations in *HW1.java*
3. Run the included JUnit tests to ensure your solution passes all the unit tests - do this by running *RunAllTests.java*
4. Upload your completed *HW1.java* file to the HW1 Dropbox

### Notes:
- The specification of what to do for each of the problems appears as a comment just above the operation in the *HW1.java* file
- There are no documenting/commenting requirements for this assignment

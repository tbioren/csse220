# HW2DArrays

## Overview:
- This exercise will provide practice with the 2D array data structure.
- There are 4 operations to be implemented for this assignment - implementing all 4 is required.
- There is a 5th operation (called *ballRestElevation*) to be implemented for extra credit - implementing *ballRestElevation* is optional.
- You may collaborate with one partner on *one* problem. If you choose to work with a partner on one problem, add a comment on the top of that method indicating who you worked with.
- For FUN (you can work with anyone): there is an extra hard challenge (FunGameOfLife.java) included as well which allows you to simulate Conway's Game of Life.

## Rubric:
- This is an autograded assignment. Passing 100% of the unit tests earns 100% on the assignment. If you choose to do the extra credit problem, you will pass more than 100% of the assignments and earn a score greater than 100%.
- There is no documentation requirement for this assignment.
- If you fail to include a help citation, you will lose 1 point.

## To do:
1. In Eclipse, import this project (HW2DArrays) from your local copy of the CSSE220 repo
1. Implement the 4 operations in *Homework2DArrays.java*. 
1. Run the included JUnit tests to ensure your solution passes all the unit tests - do this by running *RunAllTests.java*
1. Each student uploads her or his completed *Homework2DArrays.java* file to the HW2DArrays Dropbox

## Notes:
- The specification of what to do for each of the problems appears as a comment just above the operation in the *Homework2DArrays.java* file
- We highly recommend that you seek out a partner to collaborate on one of the operations. <br>Why?<br>Because you will be working on a multi-week project with at least 1 partner toward the end of this quarter. Now is a good time to find someone you can work with.
